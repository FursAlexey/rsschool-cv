### Summary
Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites.  I gained experience of working in this area by working on few projects.
I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
